# Relieve | Re-Live

Relieve is a company based in Lichfield, Staffordshire that aspires to help the everyday person know more about mindfulness and meditation through its site information and available classes.

HERE WILL BE AN IMAGE OF MY RESPONSIVE FIGMA PROTOTYPE ON 3 DEVICES

## UX

### Project Goal

To improve the average persons knowledge of mindfulness and meditation, and the positive impact it can potentially have on their mental health.

#### Patient Goals

Many people wouldn’t feel comfortable being able to go to therapy sessions, whether in groups or one-to-one, phobias are diverse and complicated, and people can fear anything. Other people know someone who is struggling but have no idea how to help. For those people, the page describing how to overcome a panic attack would be extremely beneficial, and the sessions could be something they work up to.

- Calming spacious UX
- Empowering images
- Images of a fun class environment
- Information on why they feel this way
- Self help tips

#### Carer Goals

Any friend or relative of a sufferer can be considered a carer. They, at times, have a harder time than the sufferer as they are the one that is depended on.

- Information on classes location and times
- Information on how to stop a panic attack

#### Developer and Business Goals

We are passionate in the belief that all people should have access to these lessons and this network. It’s not just a lesson that you take part in and walk away, it’s a community of people looking out for each other.

There are a vast amount of people right now struggling with bad mental health. This means a lot of people could potentially use this meaning a lot of custom.

Maybe the company could invest time into doing school presentations, to create brand awareness as well as help young people understand mental health better, as it's often young people who struggle.

- Promotes inclusion
- Brings together a community
- Life saving advice and information
- Keeps people intrigued through regular newsletters
- Ensures the user either signs up to a newsletter, or attends a class

### User Stories

As someone who struggles with anxiety, I want:
- Calming, spacious UX that isn't cluttered and therefore stressful
- Peace enducing colours to subconsciously add to the sites serenity.
- To learn a bit about why I feel the way I feel and how to get better
- To know where my classes are and how to get there, so I feel safe

As someone who struggles with depression, I want:
- To know that I'm not alone, through images and tutor information
- To be ensured that people gain happiness from the classes
- Something that regularly makes me feel good as opposed to a one-time fix, something that stays with me for longer

As a relative or friend of a struggler, I want:
- To know where classes are and what times they are
- To know that my friend/relative is going to have an educational but fun experience
- To learn a bit myself so I can be of better help to my friend/relative


### Design Choices

The overall experience needs to feel calm, decluttered and peaceful.

#### Fonts

- The primary font "Exo" was chosen because it has a nice rounded edge to the lettering, there is nothing sharp that sticks out, adding to the calm feel.
- The secondary font chosen is sans serif.

#### Icons

- All icons chosen are to describe the paragraph of text next to them, some have been taken out once viewed on a phone to help create space for the reading of the text.

#### Colours

LOOK INTO

#### Styling

- Divs have been given rounded edges to again add to that calming feeling, we dont want sharp and aggresive.
- This edging and spacing between divs and sections has been made consistent throughout the pages and content.

#### Backgrounds

- Either hero images relevant to the page have been shown, white, or off-white (#FAFAFA) have been used.
- This is so that the site is not too distracting from the content and not add to stress levels of the viewer.

#### Images

- The first image is a positive meditation one, almost putting the user directly into the class.
- The Sign Up page image is an adventurous one, which represents the user moving forward with their life or doing something "out there". It also adds a sense of freedom.
- The images of the tutors give familiarity to the user, which helps them find a safe space.

### Competitor Review

Who else is there local to Lichfield, Staffordshire with similar business goals/models?

Tarakmc.org/branch-classes/

Pros:
They are a charity with a lot of background information, and ties to Buddhism, so you know you’re learning meditation properly.

Cons:
Way too much information on the website. Way too many places to click to, too much on each page. Writing is small. Photo gallery images are not relevant, no images of the sessions themselves just of a building and a staircase? Donations doesn’t open donations page.

thebrightpath.co.uk/meditation-classes-Lichfield/

Pros:
Really positive videos with music to match. Brilliant content. Responsive design is very good. Lots of helpful content and it looks like they have an intriguing course, a great product.

Cons
Too much written again, a bit too much information on each page. If you click on find a class, it opens a different site under the same URL? The structure of the site is very confusing, the Navbar changes and it makes you feel like you’re using a different site. Once you open FAQ first thing you notice is a change in text size and spacing, webpages are supposed to be consistent.

### Roadmap

TO DO

## Features 

### Existing Features

UPDATE?

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The main navigation bar uses the websites main colour in different shades from left to right to signal different pages and look more stylish.
  - It is responsive, it condenses into a burger icon as the webpage is made smaller for tablets and phone devices.
  - The Navbar also responds by changing background and text colour as the user hovers over each page option.

NAVBAR IMAGE

- __Footer__

  - The footer includes links to the websites main social media links, I have included the most commonly used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram whilst also including TikTok, as this site could promote short promotional videos of meditation on there.

  - I have also provided information about where the business is based, this will help with the SEO of the website, as people who live in Lichfield, Staffordshire are more likely to find this page.

IMAGE OF FOOTER

- __Logo__

  - The idea for the logo was to make the middle "e" a different colour son that it could be read in two different ways. Relieve and Re-Live.
  - Since the company is focused on empowering people, it made sense to include the idea of restarting your life with a clean slate or, re-living.

IMAGE OF LOGO

- __The landing page hero image__

  - I wanted an image that was both happy and focused on meditation, the one I have found I think is brilliant because there is also a pregnant woman in the background, which represents inclusion.

LANDING PAGE IMAGE

- __Who we are section__

  - This section is a brief overview of the whole site, once the user views this they have more knowledge of what this site is to be used for.

- __Class Boxes__

  - Stuff

- The classes give opportunity for people to meet other people face-to-face and share stories, meaning that there is a positive productive social circle. The Sign-Up page could include a mailing list, so the users have useful, positive information sent their way regularly.

### Features Left to Implement

- __Stories Section__

  - Initially, I intended to have a stories page on the site, which would include stories from people who have used the service whilst in a position of anxiety or depression, and how their journey was.

  - As this business is just starting, it doesn't make sense to implement this page just yet, we could encourage users to share their stories which would empower them, and give them a sense of accomplishment, whilst also letting future users know that this is a process they can trust.

WIREFRAMING IMAGE

- __Unhelpful thinking section__

    We could implement a page on unhelpful thinking habits. This could include black and white thinking and generalisations, to help the user see what they are doing day-to-day in their head and why it is unhelpful.

## Testing 

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
