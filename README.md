## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The main navigation bar uses the websites main colour in different shades from left to right to signal different pages and look more stylish.
  - It is responsive, it condenses into a burger icon as the webpage is made smaller for tablets and phone devices.
  - The Navbar also responds by changing background and text colour as the user hovers over each page option.

- __Footer__

  - The footer includes links to the websites main social media links, I have included the most commonly used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram whilst also including TikTok, as this site could promote short promotional videos of meditation on there.

  - I have also provided information about where the business is based, this will help with the SEO of the website, as people who live in Lichfield, Staffordshire are more likely to find this page.

IMAGE OF FOOTER

- __Logo__

  - The idea for the logo was to make the middle "e" a different colour son that it could be read in two different ways. Relieve and Re-Live.
  - Since the company is focused on empowering people, it made sense to include the idea of restarting your life with a clean slate or, re-living.

IMAGE OF LOGO

- __The landing page hero image__

  - I wanted an image that was both happy and focused on meditation, the one I have found I think is brilliant because there is also a pregnant woman in the background, which represents inclusion.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
